Since the code was written to abide the OCP Principle, the changes made were minimal.

The changes made with the addition of the rectangle shape type were:
1. A new class 'Rectangle' was created.
2. The abstract method 'public String Draw()' in Interface Shape was defined inside the 'Rectangle' class to return the string 'Drawing Rectangle\n'.
3. Inside the Solution class' method WhatShapeIsIt, a new condition was added to the switch case that now also checks for the string 'Rectangle' and returns 
an object of Rectangle class type.
4. A new test case was written for the new possible inputs.
